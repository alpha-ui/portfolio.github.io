            <p>The name's Akky (which is short for Akshay, depending on where you know me from). I'm a 23-year-old from India with a tech sort of background and a lot to say about the trends and direction of the contemporary design
                world.</p>
            <p>I wanted to be an engineer for most of my life. By the time I changed my mind about that, my liaison with the applied sciences had drastically altered my worldview already. This still informs much of my work and work ethic - design is no less
                of a science in my eyes than physics or computing. (In other words, I like design as long as I can be a nerd about it.)</p>

            A good grasp of object-oriented programming and computer related queries as a whole. Proficient in CSS and HTML.
